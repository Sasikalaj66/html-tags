<h4><li>Rani Lakshmi Bai</li></h4>
<p>No other woman warrior in the history of India has made such a powerful impact on the minds of the Indian people as the Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmi Bai. She was the second wife of the ruler of Jhansi Raja Gangadhar Rao who protested against the ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. She refused to surrender Jhansi and fought bravely attired as a male during the Revolt of 1857 and died on the battlefield fighting the British forces. Her courage inspired many Indians to rise against the alien rule.</p>

<p>Sarojini Naidu holds pride of place among women freedom fighters of India. She was responsible for awakening the women of India. She was the first Indian woman president of the Indian National Congress in 1925 at the Kanpur Session. In 1928, she came to the USA with the message of the nonviolence movement from Gandhiji.
